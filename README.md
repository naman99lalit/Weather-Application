# Weather-Application

## Nodejs application which is used to tell the weather of a certain place using weather APIs.


 ### 1.It was my first project in which i had used an API.

 ### 2.I have used 2 APIs for getting the weather location of a city by extracting its longitude and latitiude.

 ### 3.It is a command line application in which you just need to enter the city name and you will get the weather of the particular city.
        -> run " node app-promise.js -c "Name_of_city"
        -> You will get the temperature of that city.
   
 ### 4. I will be adding more features in it in future.
